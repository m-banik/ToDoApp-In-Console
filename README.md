# "To do list" app- In console

## About

This is a simple console application that provides possibility of adding, deleting and managing everyday tasks. The app uses local data files as a substitute of a database. The formula of an argument that should be given by the user is the following:

- --add="{content}",
- --remove="{content}",
- --list.

The Task content shouldn't be shorter than eight signs. The programme is safeguarded for various argument complications.
